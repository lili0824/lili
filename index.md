# About Me
> Hello! I am a PhD student at University of Tübingen. I am a member of the research group "Tools and culture among early hominins" in the Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology. [Here](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/prehistory-archaeology-science/research-department/early-prehistory-and-quaternary-ecology/staff/phd-candidates/li-li/) is the link to my departmental page.<br />
I am interested in understanding the link between hominin cognition and stone tool technology. My research involves conducting controlled flintknapping experiments to study the fundamental processes of flake formation and use the results to interpret the archaeological record. My work is part of the [STONECULT](https://sites.google.com/view/stonecult/home) project directed by [Dr. Claudio Tennie](https://sites.google.com/view/claudiotennie/home), which explores the early stone tools and their relationships to hominin cognition.

## PhD Thesis
My thesis is titled __An experimental approach to reconstruct the “invisible” knapping variables from the Oldowan record__.  
The emergence and development of chipped stone technology delineate the trajectory of human evolution, and represent a distinctive form of hominin culture in comparison with other species (Davidson & McGrew, 2005; Stout, 2011). To study the origin of traits that distinguish hominin culture from that of the other species, researchers often turn to the Oldowan stone tool industry (Hayden, 2008; Plummer, 2004; Toth & Schick, 2018). The Oldowan industry has the most abundant record of hominin tool behavior, and is commonly recognized for a least-effort production of sharp edges strategy (Toth, 1985). While much attention has been given to reconstructing hominins’ technical discussion from the reduction sequences of the Oldowan stone tool production (Braun et al., 2008; Braun et al., 2009; Delagnes & Roche, 2005; Roche et al., 1999), there is a lack of in-depth research on how early hominins controlled and manipulated their force delivery during knapping. The force delivery variables such as the amount of force used by the hominins to remove a flake (i.e. striking force) and the angle at which the hammer struck the core (i.e. angle of blow) cannot be directly measured from the archaeological record, thus making them “invisible” to the modern observers. In spite of that, they are important for understanding the biomechanics and technological capabilities of the early hominins.  
My thesis project aims to connect the currently invisible aspects of stone tool production to tangible lithic attributes to further explore the rationale behind the technical decisions made by the early hominins. The primary research question is: How did early hominins control angle of blow and striking force to produce the tools we see in the archaeological record? I will address the research question via a series of controlled lithic experiments followed by a study of the archaeological assemblages.
