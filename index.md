# About Me
> Hello! I am a PhD student at University of Tübingen. I am a member of the research group "Tools and culture among early hominins" in the Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology. Here is the [link]() to my departmental page.</p>
I am interested in understanding the link between hominin cognition and stone tool technology. My research involves conducting controlled flintknapping experiments to study the fundamental processes of flake formation and use the results to interpret the archaeological record. My work is part of the [STONECULT](https://sites.google.com/view/stonecult/home) project directed by [Dr. Claudio Tennie](https://sites.google.com/view/claudiotennie/home), which explores the early stone tools and their relationships to hominin cognition.

### PhD Thesis
My thesis is titled __An experimental approach to reconstruct the “invisible” knapping variables from the Oldowan record__.

### ARchaeology Library
[ARchaeology Library](https://lili0824.github.io/ARchaeology/) is a website created by me for people to view 3D models of archaeological sites and objects in augmented reality.

### Sinophobia Tracker
[Sinophobia Tracker](https://sites.google.com/view/sinophobia-tracker/home) is a website started by [Jing Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/jingwang-space/home) and I to document the sinophobia since the 2019-nCoV outbreak and people's effort to fight against it.

# Conferences and Workshops
## [Meeting StEvE 2020](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/180663)
*Co-organizer*<br />
*November 13<sup>th</sup> 2020, virtual*<br />
<br />
The annual symposium of Students in Ecology and Evolution (Meeting StEvE) is the avenue for PhD students of the EVEREST graduate school at University of Tübingen to present and discuss their work through a series of oral and poster sessions.

## [PRIMARK](https://sites.google.com/view/primarch-workshop/home?authuser=0)
*Co-organizer*<br />
*February 27<sup>th</sup> and 28, 2020, Tübingen, DE*<br />
<br />
The aim of PRIMARK (The New Methodologies in Primate Archaeology Workshop) is to bring together researchers from across various universities interested in primate archaeology. The workshop consisted of presentation and discussion sessions on the most recent approaches to studying primate archaeology. The main focus of the workshop is to share and learn about the methods that different research groups are using in order to gain insights into the evolution of human technology through the study of primate tool use.
