# About Me
> Hello! I am a PhD student at University of Tübingen. I am a member of the research group "Tools and culture among early hominins" in the Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology. [Here](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/prehistory-archaeology-science/research-department/early-prehistory-and-quaternary-ecology/staff/phd-candidates/li-li/) is the link to my departmental page.<br />
I am interested in understanding the link between hominin cognition and stone tool technology. My research involves conducting controlled flintknapping experiments to study the fundamental processes of flake formation and use the results to interpret the archaeological record. My work is part of the [STONECULT](https://sites.google.com/view/stonecult/home) project directed by [Dr. Claudio Tennie](https://sites.google.com/view/claudiotennie/home), which explores the early stone tools and their relationships to hominin cognition.

## Sinophobia Tracker
[Sinophobia Tracker](https://sites.google.com/view/sinophobia-tracker/home) is a website started by [Jing Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/jingwang-space/home) and I to document the sinophobia since the 2019-nCoV outbreak and people's effort to fight against it.
