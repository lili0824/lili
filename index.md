# About Me
> Hello! I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. My research involves conducting controlled flintknapping experiments to study the fundamental processes of flake formation and use the results to interpret the archaeological record.

# [Project Highlights](./project.md)

## PhD Thesis
My [thesis](./project.md) is titled __An experimental approach to reconstruct the “invisible” knapping variables from the Oldowan record__.

## ARchaeology Library
[ARchaeology Library](https://lili0824.github.io/ARchaeology/) is a website created by me for people to view 3D models of archaeological sites and objects in augmented reality.

## Sinophobia Tracker
[Sinophobia Tracker](https://sites.google.com/view/sinophobia-tracker/home) is a website started by [Jing Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/jingwang-space/home) and I to document the sinophobia since the 2019-nCoV outbreak and people's effort to fight against it.
