# About Me

> I am interested in understanding the link between hominin cognition and stone tool technology. My research involves conducting controlled flintknapping experiments to study the fundamental processes of flake formation and use the results to interpret the archaeological record. My work is part of the [STONECULT](https://sites.google.com/view/stonecult/home) project directed by [Dr. Claudio Tennie](https://sites.google.com/view/claudiotennie/home), which explores the early stone tools and their relationships to hominin cognition.

# Project Highlights

### PhD Thesis
My thesis is titled _An experimental approach to reconstruct the “invisible” knapping variables from the Oldowan record_.

## ARchaeology Library
ARchaeology Library is a website created by me for people to view 3D models of archaeological sites and objects in augmented reality.

## Sinophobia Tracker
[Sinophobia Tracker](https://sites.google.com/view/sinophobia-tracker/home) is a website started by [Jing Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/jingwang-space/home) and I to document the sinophobia since the 2019-nCoV outbreak and people's effort to fight against it.

## Tree Estimator Program
[The Tree Estimator Program](https://github.com/lili0824/fossil) is written in Python. It takes an ultrametric tree generated based on DNA from extant taxa, landmark coordinates of all leaf nodes to compute a new phylogenetic tree with branch lengths representing morphological change between taxa.
