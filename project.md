## My PhD Project
My thesis is titled __An experimental approach to reconstruct the “invisible” knapping variables from the Oldowan record__.  
The emergence and development of chipped stone technology delineate the trajectory of human evolution, and represent a distinctive form of hominin culture in comparison with other species (Davidson & McGrew, 2005; Stout, 2011). To study the origin of traits that distinguish hominin culture from that of the other species, researchers often turn to the Oldowan stone tool industry (Hayden, 2008; Plummer, 2004; Toth & Schick, 2018). The Oldowan industry has the most abundant record of hominin tool behavior, and is commonly recognized for a least-effort production of sharp edges strategy (Toth, 1985). While much attention has been given to reconstructing hominins’ technical discussion from the reduction sequences of the Oldowan stone tool production (Braun et al., 2008; Braun et al., 2009; Delagnes & Roche, 2005; Roche et al., 1999), there is a lack of in-depth research on how early hominins controlled and manipulated their force delivery during knapping. The force delivery variables such as the amount of force used by the hominins to remove a flake (i.e. striking force) and the angle at which the hammer struck the core (i.e. angle of blow) cannot be directly measured from the archaeological record, thus making them “invisible” to the modern observers. In spite of that, they are important for understanding the biomechanics and technological capabilities of the early hominins.  
My thesis project aims to connect the currently invisible aspects of stone tool production to tangible lithic attributes to further explore the rationale behind the technical decisions made by the early hominins. The primary research question is: How did early hominins control angle of blow and striking force to produce the tools we see in the archaeological record? I will address the research question via a series of controlled lithic experiments followed by a study of the archaeological assemblages.

[ARchaeology Library](https://lili0824.github.io/ARchaeology/) is created for people to view archaeological sites and objects in augmented reality. You can simply scan the QR code with your phone to go to the website and start playing with the 3D models.

## Sinophobia Tracker

This [site](https://sites.google.com/view/sinophobia-tracker/home) is an effort to archive and document the information on Sinophobia, its spill-over effects, and on people's efforts to counter such trends worldwide during the CoronaVirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) outbreak for future alarms against racism and xenophobia.

## Tree Estimator Program
[The Tree Estimator Program](https://github.com/lili0824/fossil) is a program that produces an evolutionary tree with branch lengths reflecting the morphological differences between nodes from a given phylogeny (an ultrametric tree), and fits a fossil to the new evolutionary tree. The input data is anultrametric tree in Newick format, landmark coordinates of all leaf nodes, and the landmark coordinates of the fossil that needs to be inserted to the tree.  The first part of the output will  be  an  updated  phylogenetic  tree  with  branch  lengths  representing  the  morphological change between nodes, and the second part is a phylogenetic tree with the foreign fossil fit to a branch that it is closest to in space.
