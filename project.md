# Projects

## My PhD thesis
My thesis is titled _An experimental approach to reconstruct the “invisible” knapping variables from the Oldowan record_.

## ARchaeology Library
![ARchaeology](/assets/img/archaeology.png)<br />
[ARchaeology Library](https://lili0824.github.io/ARchaeology/) is created for people to view archaeological sites and objects in augmented reality. You can simply scan the QR code with your phone to go to the website and start playing with the 3D models.

## Sinophobia tracker
![sino_logo](./assets/img/sino_logo.png)<br />
This site is an effort to archive and document the information on Sinophobia, its spill-over effects, and on people's efforts to counter such trends worldwide during the CoronaVirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) outbreak for future alarms against racism and xenophobia.

## Tree Estimator Program
[The Tree Estimator Program](https://github.com/lili0824/fossil) is a program that produces an evolutionary tree with branch lengths reflecting the morphological differences between nodes from a given phylogeny (an ultrametric tree), and fits a fossil to the new evolutionary tree. The input data is anultrametric tree in Newick format, landmark coordinates of all leaf nodes, and the landmark coordinates of the fossil that needs to be inserted to the tree.  The first part of the output will  be  an  updated  phylogenetic  tree  with  branch  lengths  representing  the  morphological change between nodes, and the second part is a phylogenetic tree with the foreign fossil fit to a branch that it is closest to in space.
