	<h1>About</h1>
	<p> I am a PhD student at University of TÃ¼bingen (Germany). 
        I am a member of the research group <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/toolsandculture">"Tools and culture among early hominins"</a> in the <a href = "https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/
		mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/
		prehistory-archaeology-science/research-department/early-prehistory-and-quaternary-ecology/">Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology</a>. 
        I am interested in understanding the link between hominin cognition and stone tool technology. 
        My research involves conducting controlled flintknapping experiments to study the fundamental processes of flake 
        formation and use the results to interpret the archaeological record. My work is part of the STONECULT project directed 
        by Dr. Claudio Tennie, which explores the early stone tools and their relationships to hominin cognition. </p>
